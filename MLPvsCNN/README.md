**Overview:**
This paper explores the effectiveness of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in classifying image data. It focuses on implementing these models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, investigating the impact of different network architectures, activation functions, and regularizations on model performance.

**Key Findings:**

- Comparison of MLP and CNN models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Analysis of activation functions like ReLU and Tanh, and their impact on the models.
- Exploration of model optimization through hyperparameter tuning, including learning rate and batch size adjustments.
